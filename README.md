## Traffic Sign Recognition Project

Overview 
---
This project utilizes deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs.  A model is trained and validated  so it can classify sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset).
